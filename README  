langsci-avm is aimed at typesetting beautiful feature structures, 
also known as attribute-value matrices (AVMs), for use in linguistics.

The package provides a minimal and easy to read syntax. 
It depends only on the array package and can be placed almost everywhere, 
in particular in footnotes or graphs and tree structures. The package is meant
as an update to, and serves the same purpose as, Christopher Manningâ€™s 
avm package, but shares no code base with that package.

langsci-avm was developed at Language Science Press to help in the
production of scientific texts in linguistics.
